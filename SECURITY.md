# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

Report vulnerabilities privately to the maintainers through your preferred secure channel, or by creating a private security advisory if the repository host supports it.

We will investigate and respond as quickly as possible.
