## What Is Readie?

Readie is a CLI for generating README content from structured config files.
It helps teams standardize documentation while still allowing per-project customization.

## Why Use It?

- **Consistency:** keep section order and formatting predictable across repositories
- **Speed:** update docs through config changes instead of manual copy/paste edits
- **Safety:** compare generated output with existing files before writing
- **Scale:** apply generation to many projects inside a workspace

## How It Works

1. You create a `readie.json` config in a project.
2. Readie validates and loads the config.
3. Readie renders markdown from your configured sections.
4. Readie writes `README.md` (or a custom output path) when content changed.

## Config Sources

Readie supports two config layers:

- **Project config (`readie.json`)** for package-specific content
- **Global config (`readie.global.json`)** for shared defaults across multiple projects

When both are present, project values take precedence.
