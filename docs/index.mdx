# Readie Documentation

Readie is a developer-first CLI that generates high-quality README files from a simple JSON config.

## What You Can Do

- Generate one README from a local `readie.json`
- Generate many READMEs across a workspace
- Reuse shared defaults via `readie.global.json`
- Keep docs consistent with schema-validated config files
- Preview changes safely with `--dry-run`

## Start Here

- Need config details: [Configuration](/docs/configuration)
- Working in a monorepo: [Workspace Guide](/docs/workspace)
- Need command and flag details: [CLI Reference](/docs/cli-reference)
